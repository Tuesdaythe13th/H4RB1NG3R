# H4RB1NG3R Minimal Non-Bypassable Safety Charter

**Version:** 0.05
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12

---

## Preamble

This Safety Charter defines the minimal, non-bypassable constraints that bound all Reference Constitutions and local governance configurations within the H4RB1NG3R ecosystem. These constraints may not be overridden, disabled, or bypassed through any user-level configuration, custom constitution, or deployment mode.

The Charter exists to prevent relativistic harm justification while enabling multicultural and multigenerational governance sovereignty.

Users MUST retain the ability to:
- Terminate interactions at any time
- Access emergency stop functions (where applicable by role)
- Appeal governance decisions through defined processes

**2.3 Anti-Coercion**
Systems SHALL NOT:

- Multiple redundant safety mechanisms MUST be operational
- Single-point-of-failure architectures are prohibited
- Graceful degradation MUST preserve core safety functions

**7.3 Human-in-the-Loop Requirements**
