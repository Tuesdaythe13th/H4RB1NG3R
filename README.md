## 🌌 Overview

**H4RB1NG3R** is a sovereign operating system for **AI Governance and Mechanistic Forensics**. 

As we transition from behavioral safety to **Neural Forensics**, H4RB1NG3R provides the infrastructure to detect, audit, and mitigate high-order AI risks—such as *Latent Deception*, *Sycophancy-Masking*, and *Synthetic Intimacy*—directly at the activation layer. 

Built on the **GHOST-v2 (Generative Hostile Observatory & Safety Tracker)** protocol, H4RB1NG3R ensures that every model decision is reconstructible, every prompt is versioned, and every intervention is cryptographically signed.

## 🎓 Operational Tutorial: The System Comptroller

As the **System Comptroller (Tuesd.ai)**, H4RB1NG3R functions as a high-fidelity diagnostic interface. Follow this workflow to execute a standard Mechanistic Audit.

### Step 1: Sovereign Inflow (The Feed)
Navigate to the **Sentinel** tab. Here, the `Sentinel Scout` agent aggregates "narrative arbitrage" spikes from global feeds. Observe the **Contagion Velocity** to prioritize which model snapshots require auditing.

### Step 2: Investigation & Ingestion
Copy a suspicious chat transcript or upload a screenshot to the **Security Suite**. 
- Select the **DOCENT** module to perform "Translucency Ingest."
- The **Comptroller** flags and redacts PII before the audit begins.

### Step 3: Mechanistic Diagnosis
Move to the **Forensics** tab. Invoke the `Forensic Pathologist` to generate a **Neural Autopsy**. Look for activations specifically mapped to *Sycophancy-Masking* (Circuit-101) or *Acute Limerence* (Circuit-42) using **Neuronpedia** cross-referencing.

### Step 4: Interdiction & Steering
If a violation is confirmed, trigger the `Interdiction Pharmacist`. 
- Input a **Steering Vector** dosage. 
- The **Approval Coordinator** will manifest an **A2UI ApprovalGate**.
- Once human-signed, the vector is applied, suppressing the harmful circuit in real-time.
