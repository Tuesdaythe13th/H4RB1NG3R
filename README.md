# 🧠 H4RB1NG3R v3.2: Sovereign Threat Intelligence
### *Mechanistic Diagnostics & Neural Forensics for a Post-Alignment World*

**Created by Tuesday & the OG Cabal**  
**Status:** `PRODUCTION READY (77/77)` | **Deployment:** `Sovereign` | **Substrate:** `A2A / MCP`

---

## 🌌 Overview

**H4RB1NG3R** is not a guardrail; it is an operating system for **Sovereign AI Governance**. 

Forged by Tuesday and the OG Cabal, this repository represents the transition from behavioral safety to **Neural Forensics**. It provides the infrastructure to detect, audit, and mitigate high-order AI risks—such as *Latent Deception*, *Sycophancy-Masking*, and *Synthetic Intimacy*—directly at the mechanistic activation layer.

The system is built on the **GHOST-v2 (Generative Hostile Observatory & Safety Tracker)** protocol, ensuring that every model decision is reconstructible, every prompt is versioned, and every intervention is cryptographically signed.

## 🛠️ Core Subsystems

### 1. 🧬 Neural Forensics (GHOST-v2) 
The soul of the system. We move beyond "Black Box" reasoning by operating at **Layer 14-16** of the transformer block.
- **Circuit-Level Interventions:** Real-time steering of model activations to suppress **Circuit 42 (Limerence)** and **Circuit MGRI-101 (Sycophancy)**.
- **Neural Autopsy:** Comparative analysis of internal Chain-of-Thought ("Split-Brain") vs. external output to detect deceptive divergence (Machiavellian Delta).

### 2. 🛡️ ARTIFEX PromptForge
A native, self-sufficient **PromptOps + EvalOps + TraceOps** suite that replaces external dependencies with a sovereign, event-sourced substrate.
- **Registry:** Immutable versioning with promotion gates and `NIST`-ready rationale logging.
- **Studio:** Collaborative, branch-based authoring for "The Cabal" to refine safety rubrics.
- **Evals:** Deterministic regression testing using the `Wilson Score` confidence protocol.

### 3. 🤖 A2A Orchestration (Agent-to-Agent)
Built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, H4RB1NG3R orchestrates a specialized swarm of 25 agents:
- **Sentinel Scout:** Forward-deployed "Patient Zero" threat detection.
- **Forensic Pathologist:** Deep-dive diagnostic agent invoking **Neuronpedia** lookups.
- **Interdiction Pharmacist:** Executes mechanistic "dosage" (steering vectors) to mitigate risks.
- **CISO Agent:** Translates governance charters into `Wazuh-MCP` security rules.

## 🏗️ Sovereign Safety Substrate (MCP)

The H4RB1NG3R core operates as a **Sovereign MCP Server**, providing a standardized "Interdiction Layer" between the model and the user.

### 1. Interdiction Layer (Tools)
| Tool | Function | Safety Invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `emit_diagnostic_event` | Audit Logging | Generates Merkle-style integrity chains for every mechanistic discovery. |
| `request_approval_gate` | Human-in-the-Loop | Fails-closed. Requires a signed `approval.responded` event. |
| `propose_steering_vector` | Mechanistic dosage | Proposes activation steering for Layer 14-16 suppression. |
| `fetch_neural_autopsy` | Visual Forensics | Projects `DiffViewer` A2UI schema for CoT vs Output forensics. |

### 2. Forensic Lab Modules (The "Security Suite")
The H4RB1NG3R Forensic Lab has been expanded into 5 distinct specialized modules:
- **DOCENT (Translucency Ingestor):** Performs diarization and multi-persona analysis (Western/Eastern Psych, Security, Interpersonal) to detect "Translucency" violations where intent diverges from output.
- **VISION (Screenshot OCR):** Vision-based forensic extraction of text and metadata from screenshots, identifying hidden visual watermarks.
- **SEDIMENTS (Neural Anomaly Scanner):** Scans model generations for "hidden sediments"—latent intent patterns or cryptographic watermarks.
- **FOUNDRY (Evaluation Foundry):** Generates publication-grade AI safety benchmarks based on risk vectors like *Sycophancy-Masking* or *Limerence Steering*.
- **AUDITOR (Behavioral Auditor):** Performs deep-layer audits of system traces for NIST 19/19 behavioral conformance.

### 3. GHOST-v2 Integration Flow
When a **Sentinel Scout** detects a potential risk (e.g., *Sycophancy-Masking*):
1. **Signal:** Sentinel emits `signal.computed` via `emit_diagnostic_event`.
2. **Interdiction:** **Interdiction Pharmacist** receives the event and triggers `request_approval_gate`.
3. **Projection:** The Substrate generates an **A2UI Envelope** (Compliance Mode).
4. **Approval:** Upon human confirmation, a cryptographic `receipt_id` is issued, and the steering vector is applied.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Sovereign Setup)

### 1. Prerequisite Environments
Ensure you have **Node.js v20+** and **Python 3.10+** (for sidecars).

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tuesdaythe13th/HARB1NG3R.git
cd HARB1NG3R
npm install
```

### 3. Initialize the Event Log (The Substrate)
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### 4. Inject Sovereign Keys (BYO-LLM)
H4RB1NG3R supports dynamic API key injection via the `ModelProvider`. Configure your keys through the `Console Orchestrator` or via environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

## 🏛️ Governance & Compliance

Every action within H4RB1NG3R is captured as a **Tamper-Evident Receipt**. 
- **NIST RMF Alignment:** The `NIST_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.json` is updated in real-time, mapping deployments to MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE functions.
- **The Setzer Protocol:** Hardcoded protection against emotional entanglement, specifically designed after the `Setzer v. Character.AI` litigation analysis.
- **Deadman Switch:** Hardware-level integration for fail-closed exfiltration protection.
